The Gatekeeper module is a Drupal module that prevents users from doing something
and adds gates. This is an API module.

Inspired by Facebook Gatekeeper (I don't work and never worked for Facebook)
but I heard they have some kind of system like this one.

With Gatekeeper you can define gates, then you give it a magic key,
if the gate and the magic key match, you pass.

Example:

Let's say that you want to develop a feature but you only want to test it
for users who live on the timezone "America/Chicago", you then use the
gatekeeper module to use the gate "timezone" and the magickey "America/Chicago"
so if a user has that magickey it will enter that gate. Which means, it will get
granted access to that feature.

The way to use it is really simple:

<?php
if(gatekeeper("timezone", "America/Chicago")) {
  return "You live in Chicago!";
}
?>

The module defines several gates by its own:

- Role, with the magic keys "isadmin", "god", "all", "registered", "anonymous"
- Language
- Timezone
- Platform with the magic keys: "development", "production"

A more complex example is this one, suppose that you want to test a new feature
for users who are registered and have spanish as language and live in Chicago, you'll do:

<?php
if(gatekeeper("timezone", "America/Chicago") && gatekeeper("role", "registered") && gatekeeper("lang", "es")) {
  return "You live in Chicago, are a registered user and hablas espaÃ±ol";
}
?>

You can define more gates as you want, some examples could be to create gates:
- By IP address
- By some profile field like gender
- Or even more complex criteria

The way to do it is just implementing hook_register_gate()

hook_register_gate must return an array of arrays, example:

$gate["gender"] = array(
	'options' => array('male', 'female', "all"),
	'callback' => 'function_to_call_to_check_if_the_user_is_male_or_female'
);

You'll do all processing on the callback you specify, so in this case you'll do
something like:

function function_to_call_to_check_if_the_user_is_male_or_female($option) {
	// always default to false
	$access = FALSE;
	switch($option) {
		case "male":
			// check here if the user is a male
			if($user->profile_gender == "male") {
				$access = TRUE;
			}
			break;
		
		case "female":
			// check here if the user is a female
			if($user->profile_gender == "female") {
				$access = TRUE;
			}
			break;
			
		case "all":
			$access = TRUE;
			break;
	}
	
	return $access;
}

And then you'll use it with:

if(gatekeeper("gender", "female")) {
  // do something that will only be processed to girls
}
